* M.Sc. in Computer Science, University of Chicago, 2021
* Ph.D. Étudiant en Oceanographié, Université Laval, 2025 (expected)

Work experience
======
* 2016-2021: Community Ecology of Primary Producers in the Pacific Northwest
  * <i>Tatoosh Island, Makkah Reservation, WA, USA</i>
  * Designed and carried out a three-year experiment examining the alternate stable states
of kelp and surfgrass. The study focused on differences in nutrient cycling and the
effects of alternate stable states on biogeochemistry and diversity.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Cathy Pfister

* 2019 – 2021: Nitrogen Fixing Genetics
  * <i>Tatoosh Island, Makkah Reservation, WA, USA</i>
  * Used genetic techniques (PCR, Gel electrophoresis) to detect the nitrogen fixing
capability of <i>Phyllospadix</i> meadows. Developed metagenomic workflows for the functional 
and taxnomic understanding of host-microbe symbiont systems in the nearshore intertidal.
