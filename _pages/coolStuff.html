I've done some cool stuff. I've captured a wee bit of it. Have at it.

<br>Tricky clip I made for the Marine Biological Laboratory. Middle of the pandemic and we had this idea of making a testimonial video of the student's experience at the MBL. Tried to find a way to incorporate videos coming in with different qualities, styles, interview forms while also giving some student friendly visuals.
