title: "Impact of Anthropogenic N-loading on Sulfate-Reducing Diazotrophic Communities in New England Salt Marshes"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-12-31-MBL-nfix
excerpt: 'Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF) is an ancient microbial process crucial to oligotrophic
ecosystems in which inert N2 atmospheric gas is reduced to bioavailable ammonium (NH4+).
New England salt marshes are one such ecosystem that harbors a diverse community of N-fixing
microbes that satisfy the high N-requirement of this productive system. Increased sewage outfall
and fertilizer deposition fulfills, in part, this N-requirement. This study addresses how BNF
responds to human based N-loading in salt marshes with an emphasis on Sulfate-reducing Nfixers. 
We compared sediments across sites that had high and low NO3- and NH4+ concentrations in order 
to determine the effect of elevated nutrient concentrations on BNF. We selected sites
from the Great Sippewissett Marsh and Plum Island based on where we observe near-pristine
conditions and where we see anthropogenic nitrogen loading in the form of sewage or fertilizer.
The Acetylene Reduction Technique was used to quantify N-fixation, colorimetry was used to
determine environmental N-concentrations and the Polymerase chain reaction allowed us to see
whether the N-fixing gene, nifH, was being expressed as mRNA. NH4+ was found to inhibit Nfixation, while NO3- 
doesn’t reveal any strong trends. MoO42- addition assays were used to
inhibit SO42- reduction, allowing us to determine the contribution of sulfate reducing-N-fixation
to BNF. The N-fixing community at Plum Island are almost entirely dominated by sulfate
reducers and are significantly different from that at the Great Sippewissett Marsh (p<0.001).
Cores from Reference marshes were also incubated anaerobically for 16 days under different N-loading 
regimes to look at short term effects of N-loading on BNF. The anaerobic incubations
substantially reduced N-fixation across all treatments but no significant differences were
observed between treatments.'
